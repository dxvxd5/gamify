## How to use the app
The application is accessible [here](https://gamify-perso.web.app/#login). Players log in with their Spotify accounts. Once logged in, they can either create their own room or join an existing room. In a room, they can invite their friends to play one of two different music-related quiz games, one of which use the Spotify API to play audio tracks. The games are:
- Song guess: Here the user listen to a song and have to choose the correct title of it
- Quiz game: Here the user will respond to questions to test their general knowledge in music

## How to run the app locally

```json
{
 "rooms": {"gamify":1},
 "users": {"gamify":1}
}
```
- [Add a new app](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/) to your [Spotify for developper dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications). Edit [the settings](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/) of this newly created app and add `http://localhost:3000/#login` as a redirect URI. 
- Download the app folder in the main branch
- On your computer open the terminal in the `gamify` folder
- Install the dependencies of the application by running `npm install` in the terminal
- Create a `.env` file in the `gamify` folder.
