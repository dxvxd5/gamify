# gamify
 
Gamify is a web application meant to bring people together online. Players login with their Spotify accounts, and are redirected to a welcome page. There, they can either create their own room or join an existing room. In a room, they can invite their friends to play one of two different music-related quiz games, some of which use Spotify to play audio tracks or retrieve personal information from Spotify about the user (with their consent, of course). The games are:

Song guess: Here the user listen to a song and have to choose the correct title of it
Music quiz game: Here the user will respond to questions to test their general knowledge in music
